# FarmLog
Logs loot, monster kills, honor and instances. Know exactly what your farm session has yielded.

** To do
* Measure farm session time
* Count instance IDs (total & last hour)
* Allow named sessions, save data per session seperately
* Maybe treat instance name as a session name
* Calculate total AH value for items
